House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark went to King's landing where he made lots of friends and lived
happily ever after...  He definitely didn't get axe murdered.

This is a story... of a man named Neddy... and three very badass really
awesome girls

This is what I want to happen to Ned. He dies a slow and fun death.

Here is a change!!
